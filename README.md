### 1. Set Up a New React.js Project Using Create React App

1. **Install Create React App**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   This will create a new directory called `my-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies for a React project.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom axios json-server@0.17.4
   ```
   - `react-router-dom` is used for routing.
   - `axios` is used for making HTTP requests.
   - `json-server` is used for creating a mock REST API.

### 2. Create the Components

- **Home**: Displays a welcome message and brief introduction.
- **About**: Provides information about the application and its purpose.
- **Products**: Displays a list of products fetched from the JSON Placeholder API. This page should be private and accessible only to authenticated users.
- **Description**: Displays detailed information about a specific product selected by the user.
- **Login**: A simple login form for users to authenticate themselves.

### 3. Implement Routing Using React Router DOM

1. **Set Up Routes**:
   - Define routes for `Home`, `About`, `Products`, `Description`, and `Login` components.

2. **Private Routes**:
   - Create a mechanism to ensure that the `Products` page is only accessible to authenticated users. This typically involves checking if a user token is present in local storage or context.

### 4. Use Axios to Make Network Requests

1. **Fetch Products**:
   - In the `Products` component, use Axios to fetch a list of products from `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`.

2. **Fetch Product Details**:
   - In the `Description` component, fetch details of a specific product when a user navigates to the page.

### Using Vite for a React.js Project Setup

1. **Create a New Vite Project**:
   - First, ensure you have Node.js installed.
   - Use the following command to create a new Vite project:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template react
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-vite-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install react-router-dom axios json-server@0.17.4
   ```

4. **Configure Vite**:
   - Vite configuration is minimal. By default, it creates a `vite.config.js` file, which you can customize if needed.

5. **Create Components and Implement Routing**:
   - Follow the same steps as described above for creating components and implementing routing using React Router DOM.

6. **Run the Vite Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server, and your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
